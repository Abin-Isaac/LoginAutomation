## 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a modular automation test framework built using **Java, Selenium, and TestNG**, targeting login functionalities on **OrangeHRM** and **Facebook**. The framework focuses on reusability, maintainability, and real-world test practices.

Designed as a portfolio project, it reflects how I apply structured QA thinking, from framework setup to test validation — with practical insights gained from both learning and execution.

## 🧠 New: SQL Testing Practice for QA

As part of my QA journey, I’ve added SQL-based validation relevant to test scenarios like login failures, order processing, and user data checks.

📄 **Location**: [`sql-testing/sample_login_queries.sql`](sql-testing/sample_login_queries.sql)

### Includes:
- Users, LoginAttempts, and Orders tables
- Sample `INSERT` data
- Queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY` for test data validation
- Practical for validating test cases and DB logic

### 🔧 Run It:
```bash
sqlite3 login_test.db < sql-testing/sample_login_queries.sql
```

## 🧠 QA Learning Highlights (T3 Series)
> _“Think it. Test it. Talk it — with T3.”_

This project is part of my ongoing QA journal where I explore deeper insights into testing beyond tools:

- 🔍 UI elements can lie — OrangeHRM taught me about invisible bugs.
- 🧘‍♂️ Waits that work — from `Thread.sleep()` to smart waits.
- 🧩 Small utility, big impact — how `DemoUtils.pause()` helped debug smarter.

📝 I share these reflections regularly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abin-isaac) under `#abiNwriteS` and `#T3`.

## 🚀 How to Run the Tests

Run from terminal using Maven:

```bash
# OrangeHRM Login Test
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng-orangehrm.xml

# Facebook Login Test
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng-facebook.xml

🏁 6-Day QA Skill Enhancement Sprint — In Progress

🚀 I’ve officially started a 6-day focused sprint to enhance and document my QA automation skillset through structured, hands-on modules.

Below is the full roadmap with daily objectives and progress tracking:

Day	Module / Folder	Description	Status

1	📂 sql-testing/	Real-world SQL tables + QA validation queries (Users, LoginAttempts)	✅ Done

2	📂 docs/test-plan/	Manual test plan & test case writing (OrangeHRM login flow)	⬜ Not done

3	📂 regression_suite/	Regression testing using Selenium-TestNG refactor	⬜ Not done

4	📂 performance/	Basic performance testing using JMeter (login load test)	⬜ Not done

5	📂 tdd-demo/	Password reset flow built using TDD principles	⬜ Not done

6	📂 hybrid-approach/	Demonstrating manual + automation hybrid testing approach	⬜ Not done

—	📂 docs/reports/	QA reports: execution summary, test status, blockers	⬜ Not done

—	🔧 GitHub Issues / PRs	Simulated collaboration: bug reporting, code reviews, and resolution steps	⬜ Not done

✅ I’ll mark each module as complete once uploaded to GitHub, with a README and commit reference.
